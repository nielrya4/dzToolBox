## **Conclusion**

The project already has excellent foundations with its user management, data visualization, and core statistical tools. The most impactful next steps would be implementing the machine learning components and expanding the multi-proxy capabilities, as these would significantly differentiate dzToolBox from existing tools while addressing current research frontiers in detrital geochronology.

The current implementation demonstrates solid understanding of geochronological workflows and provides a strong platform for these enhancements. Focus should be placed on features that leverage the web-based nature of the platform while maintaining the accessibility and ease-of-use that makes dzToolBox valuable to the geochronology community.
